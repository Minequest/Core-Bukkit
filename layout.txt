Quests
	- Tasks
		- Events

Each Quest has Tasks to complete.
Each task has events to complete.
Each event will do something, then complete. Or will wait on something, then complete.
Each task will call events, wait for all of them to finish, then call other tasks
based on that. 
		
Each event, on finishing, will fire a EventCompletionEvent.
Each task, on finishing, will fire a TaskCompletionEvent.
Each quest, on finishing, will fire a QuestCompletionEvent.

Events are nothing special. They just fire off events and it's up to respective addons to use them.
The CORE plugin should not implement Events or Abilities.
