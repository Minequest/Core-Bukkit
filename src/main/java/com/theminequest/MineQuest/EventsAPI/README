QEvents are extensions of Event for MineQuest.
How does this work?

Tasks have sets of QEvents that need to be fulfilled.
The task will not be finished until this happens.

Tasks will async-monitor to check if the task has completed.
If it has, it will fire off ALL EVENTS with the Bukkit Event System
for MineQuest + addons to take care of.

"A task is a group of Events that will get activated when the task is issued.
There are some Events that issue Tasks when certain things happen, and when Tasks
are issued the activate Events. Tasks have an id (should be unique), and when Events
that issue events are setup they must be given a Task id to activate. If the id is
-1 then the quest is completed, and if the id is any other negative number then no
task is issued. The task also takes a comma separated list of Event ids that should
be activated when it is issued."
